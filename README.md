# Catpac: a Contig Alignment Tool for Pairwise Assembly Comparison

Catpac is a Python script that conducts a focused, iterative *de novo* assembly.

The user gives Catpac two files of assembled contigs from very closely related specimens.  Catpac will conduct a BLAST search between the two and output two files the alignments.

The purpose of Catpac is to produce two reduced sets of the assemblies that are more easily compared.
